Ex: Employee Wage Computation Problem
	UC1 - Emplyee Attendance
	UC2 - Calculate Daily Wage
	UC3 - Part time
	UC4 - Switch Case
I am taking the above mention example to write my git commands

step 12: git checkout -b UC1_EmployeeAttendance
step 13: Write your code for use case 1 & test it. If it is working fine then you are ready to go
step 14: Now git add . -> git commit -> git push origin "UC1_EmployeeAttendance"
step 15: git checkout main
step 16: git merge UC1_EmployeeAttendance
step 17: git push origin main

step 18: git checkout -b "UC2_EmpDailyWage"
step 19: Write your code for use case 2 & run it.
step 20: Now git add . -> git commit -> git push origin UC2_EmpDailyWage
step 21: git checkout main
step 22: git merge UC2_EmpDailyWage

step 23: Write your code for use case 3 & run it.
step 24: Repeat steps from step 12 to step 17 for every new case
